[1]  THE STORY SO FAR...
========================

You sat in front of the computer for hours, trying once again to create a
masterpiece of a level.  But nothing seems to go correctly.  First, the
doors don't seem to work.  Then, the Hall of Mirrors appears throughout
your level.  Stairs seem to be impassable.  Lifts don't work right.  Demons
seem to fire through walls without trouble.

Finally, you sigh in frustration, and quit the editor.  "I'll never make
this work, I'll just let those other people try making levels...  they can
do all the work."  You think sadly of all the masterpieces you had planned
that will now never be completed, but resign yourself to your fate.

*ZZZAP!*  There is a blinding flash of green light, and an Imp holding a
disk appears next to you.  The Imp grins at you, well, impishly.  You stare,
stunned.

"So, you don't know how to make a level, eh?  I have right here some
levels that you could look at, and learn from.  They're rather fun ones,
too."  The Imp grins at you.  "Why don't you pop in this disk, and take a
look?"

You narrow your eyes suspiciously.  "What's the catch?"

The Imp tries to look innocent.  "Nothing much really, just a
trifle... only a small fraction of your soul... or we COULD make other
arrangements if you really want to..."

You turn away.  "I'm not THAT desperate to make a level..."  You hope the
Imp will leave.  The Imp does not oblige you.  Instead, he grows angry.
He looks like he's about to toss a fireball at you, and you feel like
reaching for a shotgun.  Instead, the Imp halts.  "Nooo...  I have a better
idea...  I will let you have these levels... on one condition.  YOU SURVIVE
THEM FIRST!"

You shrug.  "I'm a good DOOM player, and they can't be THAT hard."

The Imp grins.  "As DOOM levels, no.  But if you TRULY experience them..."
He breaks off and laughs evilly.

As you wonder what he means, you find yourself enveloped in a green
glow.  The last thing you hear is the Imp, still laughing.

You come to, and find yourself wearing a DOOM-style Marine outfit.  "Oh,
no, I'm in the game!" you think to yourself.  You realize that the only
way out is to successfully complete all the levels.  The Imp's voice rings
out mockingly.  "So, you want to play with editors, huh?  Well, now you're
in for it!  You're KNEE-DEEP IN THE DEU!"

[2] THE ARCHITECTS OF HELL
==========================

This episode is intended as a tutorial for DEU users, as well as a quick
little piece of work to show off the DEU tester's level-making skills.

The whole episode is fairly small, it's not intended to require much
skill, just to be somewhat fun and give you ideas.  Besides, if it was
that big, the ZIP file for DEU 5.1 would be huge!  So just sit back and
enjoy the tour of DEU's capabilities in levelmaking.

All these levels are suitable for single-player, cooperative or deathmatch
play, at all difficulty settings.  They all have some secret places where
you can find useful stuff.

This intro text was written by Jeremy Blackman.  The demos were created
by the DEU beta-testers (information for each level follows) and edited
by Steve Bareman and Rapha‰l Quinet.

Description             : A simple level, layout-wise,
  originally designed exclusively for Deathmatch, but adapted
  for one player games as well. Features :
     - Exiting on Deathmatch is difficult unless you co-operate
     - Several "stages" based in the same area. Just when you
       think you've finished ...
     - Last "stage" is the hardest, but you can exit without
       completing it.
  This level is mainly a shoot-the-bad-guy level; Completion is
  easy with a minimum of kills, but the aim is to get 100% kills.

usage.  One more major bonus to this level is, OH YES, THEME!! No more helter
